During FlippyDrive install
==========================

- **The flex cable doesn't reach the FlippyDrive**

  This can happen if you skip :ref:`this step <fpcfold>` or if the flex cable unfolds when placing the drive. Take the drive off if installed, verify the flex cable is still properly tucked between the drive/plug and heat sink, then try again.
  Once the drive/plug is in place, you can gently pull on the flex cable to test the slack length.


- **The GameCube shows an error ('An error has occurred.') with the FlippyDrive connected / the bootloader menu doesn't launch after installing**

  Please check if the flex cable is correctly inserted into the drive connector. Make sure you folded it correctly into a W-like shape with the gold connectors of the flex cable inserted in the middle section of the connector.

- **The GameCube hangs on 'Firmware is booting' while in the bootloader**

  Please ask for help on the Discord server or submit a ticket. Links are at the top of this page.

- **I damaged the flex cable, what now?**

  You can order a replacement ribbon `here <https://teamoffbroadway.com/product/flippydrive-flex/>`_.

- **My order didn't come with mounting screws**

  Recent FlippyDrives use an updated frame design that doesn't require screws. The lower mounting tab fits into the slot where the lower screw used to go, and the FlippyDrive snaps into the frame. While there is still a screw hole present as a backup, screws are not needed for normal installation.
  The frame uses M1.6 5mm screws, but M1.8 or M2.0 screws will also fit if those are easier to obtain.

- **The mounting frame is damaged.**

  If your mounting bracket was damaged during shipping or installation, you can print a replacement using the 3D model files (STL) available for download below.
  You can use your own 3D printer or have it printed at a local library, maker space, or through an online printing service. If this is not an option for you, contact `customer support <https://help.teamoffbroadway.com/portal>`_.


  .. note:: They can be printed with no supports so long as your printer has reasonable bridging performance to form the slot for the bottom mounting tab of the FlippyDrive.

First Boot
==========

- **I see the bootloader on first boot/pressing X but get a black screen after**

  Your connection to the cube is fully working. The flex cable and nearly all of the FlippyDrive hardware is exercised to get to this point.
      
  Make sure you're :doc:`running the latest software<updates>`. This is almost certainly a software bug and the details of your cube/install should be reported `to the issue tracker <https://github.com/OffBroadway/flippydrive/issues>`_ or `customer support <https://help.teamoffbroadway.com/portal>`_.
